# LifeSimulation
Start from broke and work your way to a successful life!

User starts with almost no money in an empty apartment with only a pair of shoes, suitcase of basic clothes, air mattress and smartphone with internet access. 

The user can take the following actions from their smartphone:

1. User can go to work to increase weath, but increase in stress will lower happiness and lack physical activity will lower fitness.

2. User can shop to purchase items for place of living, upgrade mode of transportation, and potentially other tools/investments to unlock better opportunities. 

3. User can watch online videos for free or for purchase (lowers wealth) to increase skills and fulfull job pre-requisites.

4. User can stream exercise videos to increase health and happiness.

5. User can text friends, family and significant other if they have one to increase social/love. 

6. User can relax/sleep, which will increase health and happiness, trigger night, and start a new day. 

User has a clock and calendar date on their smartphone to measure how much time they have left in the day and days or years in the overall game. 

Each action has an assigned amount of time it takes, which moves clock forward. Day ends at the same time every day, or when user clicks relax button.

User is trying to reach success in as little time as possible. TBD whether success is measured by game, user selection of life goals, or in competition with a computer/robot player - which would be measured by totaling points of measures (wealth, health, happiness, social, skills).

As user makes purchases, place of living frame will add images that reflect upgrades (ex. refrigerator, real bed, TV, etc.)

When user purchases a new method of transporation, images of those will replace the shoes or former mode of transportation.

When a user achieves a life milestone (college graduation, buying a house, starting a family), photos will be added or replaced on the memory wall of gold frames. 

Stretch goals:

1. User can apply to different jobs that become available once pre-requisites are met. 

2. User can choose avatar or customize appearance (hair color/length, gender identity, eye color, and skin color). 

3. Avatar expression changes based on happiness meter. 

4. When new day starts, perhaps triggered by relax button, screen will go dark and stars/moon will appear. Could try animating swipe down/up to reflect daylight.

5. When life milestone appears, an overlay thought bubble could appear announcing the achieving with the image that will be added to memory wall. 

6. Animations to pop up new items purchased. 

7. At start of game, avatar could slide in slowly from right side as if walking in place of living for the first time.

8. At start of game, memory wall frames could fall from top into place at staggered times.
